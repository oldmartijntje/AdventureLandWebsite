        comment: "Awesome game, fun for all ages. The art is on point, with a lot of fun jokes. The production quality is good. The gameplay mechanics are very fun. Everyone I talk to about this game likes it. Even if you think you are losing mid game, you can still win in the end. I would recommend this to pretty much every type of player. Because you can play it casually or very strategic, and both types of players can win.",
